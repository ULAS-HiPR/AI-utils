# AI-utils

Central repository for all AI/ML scripts, notebooks, and experiments.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the contents of each directory to understand and contribute to our AI/ML initiatives. Whether you're a team member working on a specific project or a contributor interested in advancing our capabilities, this repository serves as a collaborative space for innovation.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ULAS-HiPR/AI-utils.git
cd AI-utils

conda env create -f environment.yml # if you don't have the conda env created

conda activate ai-utils
```

_Note: Conda is used because it let's use pip packages also and we can control the python version. It is a bit more powerful and is easier to work with in the long run. Install either [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) to use it._

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

1. **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for various AI/ML experiments. Each notebook is designed to explore and analyze different aspects of our rocketry projects.

2. **scripts**: In this directory, you'll find scripts written in various programming languages that implement machine learning algorithms, data processing, and other AI-related functionalities. These scripts are essential for the integration of intelligent solutions into our rocketry endeavors.

_Note: Trained models should be stored on OneDrive not here._
